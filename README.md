## About the app
J-hub 
Social media platform for JNTUians
This app consists of features such as posting content, providing you with information related to placements, and so on.
It also has some unique features where one can rate the users on their profile which will reflect on the leader board.
One can also write confessions to other users of the app anonymously.
But here's a plot twist: any confession with a status of more than 10 reports will be removed immediately from the post section.
